Banoffee Pie!


Ingredients:

     For the base:

-    100g butter, melted
-    225g light digestive biscuits, crushed

     For the caramel:

-    75g butter
-    75g dark brown soft sugar
-    397g can Carnation Condensed Milk
    
     For the top:

-    2 medium bananas
-    150ml carton whipping cream, lightly whipped
-    Cocoa powder, to dust

Method:

1. Put the biscuit crumbs in your bowl, then tip in the melted butter and mix it all together. Spoon this into the base and press against the bottom and sides â€“ this is the base of the banoffee pie recipe. Chill it for ten minutes. 

2. Place 75g butter and sugar into a non-stick saucepan over a low heat, stirring all the time until the sugar has dissolved. Add the condensed milk and bring to a rapid boil for about a minute, stirring all the time for a thick golden caramel. Spread the caramel over the base, cool and then chill for about 1 hour, until firm or until ready to serve. 

 3. Carefully lift the pie from the tin and place on a serving plate. Slice the bananas; fold half of them into the softly whipped cream and spoon over the base. Decorate with the remaining bananas and finish with dusting cocoa powder on top. 

ENJOY A LOT!
