Bruschetta

Description: An Italian antipasto consisting of grilled bread topped with olive oil and a tomato mixture.

Ingredients:

-    6 or 7 ripe tomatoes (about 1 1/2 lbs)
-    2 cloves garlic, minced (about 2 teaspoons)
-    1 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil
-    1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar
-    6-8 fresh basil leaves, thinly sliced* or chopped
-    3/4 teaspoon sea salt, more or less to taste
-    1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, more or less to taste

-    1 baguette French bread or similar Italian bread
-    1/4 cup (60 ml) olive oil

Method:

*To thinly slice basil leaves, stack the leaves on top of each other and roll up like a cigar. Then make thin slices from one end of the basil cigar to the other.
MethodHide Photos

1.Blanch and peel the tomatoes: Bring 2 quarts of water to a boil. As the water is heating make shallow cuts in a cross pattern at the tip ends of the tomatoes
(this will make the tomatoes easier to peel). Once the water is boiling, remove the pot from the heat. Put the tomatoes in the hot water and blanch for 1 minute. 
Remove with a slotted spoon and let sit until cool enough to handle. Then gently peel off the tomato skins. 
Cut out the stem base with a paring knife. Cut the tomatoes into halves or quarters and squeeze out most of the juices and seeds.

2.Preheat oven to 450°F (230°C) with a rack in the top slot of the oven.

3.Chop tomatoes, toss them with garlic, olive oil, vinegar, basil, salt and pepper: Finely chop the tomatoes and place them in a medium bowl. 
Mix in the minced garlic, 1 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil, and the balsamic vinegar. Stir in the thinly sliced basil and add salt and freshly ground black pepper, adding more to taste. 
Note, tomatoes love salt; you may need to add more than you expect.

4.Toast the baguette slices: Use a bread knife to slice the baguette on the diagonal making half-inch thick slices. Brush one side of each slice with olive oil 
(a pastry brush helps here) and place olive oil-side down on a baking sheet or roasting pan. 
The baguette slices will toast best in the top rack of your oven, so you may need to work in batches to toast them all. 
When the oven has reached 450°F (230°C) place the slices in the oven on the top rack and toast for 5 to 6 minutes until lightly browned around the edges. 
If you want you can toast the bread slices without coating them first in olive oil. Toast them until lightly browned on both sides. 
Then cut a clove of garlic in half and rub over one side of the toast. Then brush with olive oil. (See Easiest Ever Garlic Bread.)

5.Serve toasted bread with tomato mixture: Arrange the toasted bread on a platter, olive oil side facing up 
(the olive oil will help create a temporary barrier keeping the bread from getting soggy from the chopped tomatoes).

6.Either serve the toasts plain with a bowl of the tomato bruschetta mixture on the side for people to top their own, or use a spoon to gently top each toasted bread slice with some of the tomato mixture. 
If you top each slice individually, do it right before serving.

Rosemary Focaccia Bread
-----------------------

Ingredients:
* 1 1/3 cup warm water (about 110°F*)
* 2 teaspoons sugar or honey
* 1 (0.25 ounce) package active-dry yeast
* 3 1/2 cups all purpose flour
* 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling
* 2 teaspoons sea salt
* 2 sprigs fresh rosemary
* flaked sea salt


1. Add warm water (*about 110°F, which you can measure with a thermometer if you want to be sure it’s the right temp) and sugar to the bowl of a stand mixer with the dough attachment, and stir to combine.  Sprinkle the yeast on top of the water.  Give the yeast a quick stir to mix it in with the water.  Then let it sit for 5-10 minute until the yeast is foamy.
2. Turn the mixer onto low speed, and add gradually flour, olive oil and salt.  Increase speed to medium-low, and continue mixing the dough for 5 minutes.  (If the dough is too sticky and isn’t pulling away from the sides of the bowl, add in an extra 1/4 cup flour while it is mixing.)
3. Remove dough from the mixing bowl, and use your hands to shape it into a ball.  Grease the mixing bowl (or a separate bowl) with olive oil or cooking spray, then place the dough ball back in the bowl and cover it with a damp towel.  Place in a warm location (I set mine by the window) and let it rise for 45-60 minutes, or until the dough has nearly doubled in size.
4. Preheat oven to 400°F.  Turn the dough onto a floured surface, and roll it out into a large circle or rectangle until that the dough is about 1/2-inch thick*.  Cover the dough with a greased piece of plastic wrap, and let the dough continue to rise for another 20 minutes.
5. Remove the plastic wrap, and transfer the dough to a large baking sheet.  Use your fingers to poke deep dents (seriously, poke all the way down to the baking sheet!) all over the surface of the dough.  Then drizzle a tablespoon or two of olive oil evenly all over the top of the dough, and sprinkle evenly with the fresh rosemary needles and sea salt.
6. Bake for 20 minutes, or until the dough is slightly golden and cooked through.  Remove from the oven, and drizzle with a little more olive oil if desired.
7. Slice, and serve warm.

-3 eggs
Squid and Courgette Flowers
-300g of baby squid
-10 courgette flowers, roughly chopped
-1 garlic clove
-8 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil
-olive oil
-salt

Method:
1. To make the pasta, place the flour on a clean surface and make a well in the centre. 
Add the eggs and bring together with your hands, gradually incorporating all the flour from the sides of the well until it forms a dough
2. Continue to knead the dough until it the texture is smooth and consistent, then transfer to a bowl. Cover with cling film and leave to rest in the fridge for 30 minutes
3. Once rested, use a pasta machine or rolling pin to roll out the dough into a sheet 0.5mm. Leave to stand for 10 minutes to dry out a little, until the dough is no longer sticky, then fold the dough over itself to form a concertina. 
Cut thin strips along the folded dough, then unfold the tagliolini and shape into nests. Dust with a little flour to avoid clumping and set aside until required
4. Heat the extra virgin olive oil in a large frying pan. Lightly crush the garlic clove with the side of a knife and sauté gently in the oil to infuse. 
Remove the garlic from the pan and discard, keeping the pan on the heat
5. Add the baby squids to the pan, seasoning with a little salt. Sauté over a high heat for a few minutes and add the courgette flowers to the pan, allowing them to wilt a little until softened.
 Remove from the heat and set to one side while the pasta cooks
6. Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil and add the tagliolini nests to the pan. Cook for 2 minutes, then drain and add to the squid and courgette flowers, mixing well until fully incorporated
7. To serve, divide the pasta evenly between four serving plates. Drizzle with olive oil, check the seasoning and serve immediately
