-    6 or 7 ripe tomatoes (about 1 1/2 lbs)

-    1 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil
-    1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar
-    6-8 fresh basil leaves, thinly sliced* or chopped
-    3/4 teaspoon sea salt, more or less to taste
-    1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, more or less to taste

-    1 baguette French bread or similar Italian bread

Method:

*To thinly slice basil leaves, stack the leaves on top of each other and roll up like a cigar. Then make thin slices from one end of the basil cigar to the other.

1.Blanch and peel the tomatoes: Bring 2 quarts of water to a boil. As the water is heating make shallow cuts in a cross pattern at the tip ends of the tomatoes
(this will make the tomatoes easier to peel). Once the water is boiling, remove the pot from the heat. Put the tomatoes in the hot water and blanch for 1 minute. 
Remove with a slotted spoon and let sit until cool enough to handle. Then gently peel off the tomato skins. 
Cut out the stem base with a paring knife. Cut the tomatoes into halves or quarters and squeeze out most of the juices and seeds.

2.Preheat oven to 450°F (230°C) with a rack in the top slot of the oven.

3.Chop tomatoes, toss them with garlic, olive oil, vinegar, basil, salt and pepper: Finely chop the tomatoes and place them in a medium bowl. 
Mix in the minced garlic, 1 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil, and the balsamic vinegar. Stir in the thinly sliced basil and add salt and freshly ground black pepper, adding more to taste. 
Note, tomatoes love salt; you may need to add more than you expect.

4.Toast the baguette slices: Use a bread knife to slice the baguette on the diagonal making half-inch thick slices. Brush one side of each slice with olive oil 
(a pastry brush helps here) and place olive oil-side down on a baking sheet or roasting pan. 
The baguette slices will toast best in the top rack of your oven, so you may need to work in batches to toast them all. 
When the oven has reached 450°F (230°C) place the slices in the oven on the top rack and toast for 5 to 6 minutes until lightly browned around the edges. 
If you want you can toast the bread slices without coating them first in olive oil. Toast them until lightly browned on both sides. 
Then cut a clove of garlic in half and rub over one side of the toast. Then brush with olive oil. (See Easiest Ever Garlic Bread.)

5.Serve toasted bread with tomato mixture: Arrange the toasted bread on a platter, olive oil side facing up 
(the olive oil will help create a temporary barrier keeping the bread from getting soggy from the chopped tomatoes).

6.Either serve the toasts plain with a bowl of the tomato bruschetta mixture on the side for people to top their own, or use a spoon to gently top each toasted bread slice with some of the tomato mixture. 
If you top each slice individually, do it right before serving.

	     and serves 4 people.

Ingredients:

-    1 tbsp olive oil
-    300 g cherry tomatoes
-    2 red peppers
-    1 large courgette zucchini
-    A generous pinch of salt and pepper
-    1 tbsp olive oil
-    1 large red onion diced
-    3 garlic cloves minced
-    225 g risotto rice
-    1 tbsp balsamic vinegar
-    250 ml passata
-    250 ml vegetable stock
-    Approx 6 sun-dried tomatoes chopped into small chunks
-    A small bunch of fresh basil torn
-    salt and pepper to taste 

Method:

    Preheat the oven to 180C / 350F and add the olive oil to a roasting tin.
    Chop the vegetables into small chunks and spread out in the tin, adding the salt and pepper before giving everything a shake to coat.
    Roast for 30 minutes.

To make the risotto:

    Meanwhile, add olive oil to a shallow casserole dish or large frying pan, on a low-medium heat.
    Sauté the onion for a few minutes before adding the minced garlic and cooking for another minute.
    Stir in the rice with the vinegar and stir for approx 30 seconds, to coat it in the oil.

    Remove from the heat and stir in the basil, salt and pepper and vegan cheese (if using). Feel free to stir in any extra oil or dairy-free butter at this point for an extra creamy risotto.
    
ENJOY!
